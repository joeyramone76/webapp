set ::releaseNotes(2.0.21) {
	This is just another bugfix release, but it introduces 1 major and 1 minor change.

	First one is this dialog that you're reading right now. It will provide you with general description
	of what's new in each new version.

	Second one is new field 'e-mail' in bug/idea report dialog. It is optional field, but it's good to fill it in,
	because:\n
	1. it will NOT be shared to anyone,\n
	2. it will NOT be published anywhere,\n
	3. It WILL be used to contact you if your bug/idea report requires some more details to be clarified,\n
	4. it will NOT be used for any other purpose.
}
